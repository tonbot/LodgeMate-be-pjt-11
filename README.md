> ## Project Description
Students of various higher institutions in Nigeria will agree that over the years, sourcing for accommodation for non-first and final year students who do not want to or are unable to get accommodation on campus has always been a nightmare. While some of the students don't have the liberty of staying in affordable accommodation within the school campus and have to outsource for the accommodation off-campus. Details about the project here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WNzoe1g9QKg_rVlbS2Kdb3A7LYKnQOwRAMDUM-07Km8/edit?usp=sharing
